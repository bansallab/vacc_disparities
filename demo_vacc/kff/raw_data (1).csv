"Notes"
"With continued limited supply of the COVID-19 vaccine, states are phasing in eligibility for the vaccine. Eligible populations vary across states.  Information on state COVID-19 vaccine priority populations is available [here](https://www.kff.org/other/state-indicator/state-covid-19-vaccine-priority-populations/). "
""
"Information in this table reflects eligibility as set by the state, except where decision-making is specifically delegated to the counties.  However, there may still be differences in eligibility across counties even in those states where decisions over who is eligible are made at the state level."
