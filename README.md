# Geographic Heterogeneity in Racial and Ethnic Disparities in COVID-19 Vaccination in the US

## Overview

This repository contains the manuscript and associated materials for the study: **"Geographic heterogeneity in racial and ethnic disparities in COVID-19 vaccination in the US"**. The work explores disparities in COVID-19 vaccination coverage across racial and ethnic groups, with a focus on urban-rural differences and the role of CDC funding. This analysis provides insights into how targeted interventions and granular data collection can improve health equity.

## Key Highlights

- **Focus:** Analysis of racial and ethnic inequities in COVID-19 vaccination across 13 U.S. states.
- **Timeframe:** Summer 2021 data.
- **Key Variables:** Urban-rural disparities, county-scale data sufficiency, and CDC funding alignment.
- **Findings:** 
  - Greater disparities in rural regions due to limited healthcare access.
  - Insufficient county-scale data poses challenges for disparity analysis.
  - CDC funding often misaligned with regions of greatest need.
- **Implications:** Importance of targeted interventions and granular data collection to address vaccination inequities.
